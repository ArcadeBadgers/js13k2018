A JS13k 2018 entry

Sadly, this is incomplete and suffered from being restarted a few times throughout the month.
There's no sound. I wrestled with sound a bit but became ill in the final week and couldn't get it sorted in time.
However, it does feel nice enough to just scoot about and link up asteroids to destroy them, before running out of power.

I also haven't tested this in an actual VR headset, but have verified it working on my phone browser and desktop browser at least.
If you do use a headset, you'll basically need to stand to look in all directions.
The warp points are always high in space, but the asteroids are mostly around the same level, so there shouldn't be too much neck strain.
The idea was to have the power points and warp points to emit a sound periodically so you could zone in on them, instead you'll have to make do with a blue line marker when you get close.

Enjoy!
